## üìú Description / Overview

**Tollverine** is a full-stack AI application designed to modernize and automate toll collection. The project addresses critical inefficiencies in traditional tolling systems, such as traffic congestion and delays for emergency services.

By leveraging a powerful AI pipeline, Tollverine provides a comprehensive solution that includes:
- **Real-time vehicle detection** and classification.
- **Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** for seamless toll deduction.
- A failsafe system to grant **unconditional priority to emergency vehicles**.
- **Stolen vehicle detection** with an integrated alert system.

The entire system is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a Next.js frontend for a dynamic user experience and a high-performance FastAPI backend to handle the AI processing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI Vehicle Detection & Classification**: Utilizes a YOLOv8 model to instantly detect vehicle types (car, bus, truck, bike, ambulance, etc.) and classify them into wheeler categories (2W, 3W, 4W+).
- **Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**: Employs a second YOLOv8 model and EasyOCR to accurately extract text from license plates, even in challenging conditions.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Automatically identifies ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles, granting them a "FREE TOLL!!" pass without delay.
- **Stolen Vehicle Detection**: Cross-references recognized license plates with a Supabase cloud database to identify stolen vehicles and sends an alert via Formspree.
- **Automated UPI Payments**: For registered users, the system deducts the correct toll fee from a linked UPI account. For unknown vehicles, it sends a manual payment alert.
- **12-Hour Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligently logs each transit and prevents double-charging the same vehicle within a 12-hour window.
- **User Authentication**: A complete login/signup system built with Firebase Authentication, including Google Sign-In and email/password options.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: A fully responsive and interactive website built with Next.js, featuring a custom animated cursor and a live scanner interface.
- **Secure Cloud Database**: All user, vehicle, and transaction data is securely managed in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/akashrajl/tollverine.git](https://github.com/akashrajl/tollverine.git)
    cd tollverine-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root of the frontend folder and add your Firebase and Supabase public keys:
    ```
    # Firebase (for login/signup)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="..."
    # ... (add all other Firebase config keys)

    # Supabase (for the 'Add Vehicle' page)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## ü§ñ Backend API

The backend for this project is a separate, private repository deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. It is a FastAPI server that handles all AI processing and database interactions.

- **Live API Endpoint:** [**https://akashrajl2104-tollverine-backend.hf.space/analyze**](https://akashrajl2104-tollverine-backend.hf.space/analyze)

## üöÄ Future Scope

- **Real UPI Payment Integration**: Replace the simulated UPI deduction with a real payment gateway API (like Razorpay or Stripe).
- **User Dashboard**: Build a dashboard where logged-in users can register their vehicles, link their UPI IDs, and view their transaction history.
- **Live Feed Implementation**: Fully implement the "Live Feed" feature on the scanner page using `react-webcam`.
